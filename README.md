# ForHire
Freelancer Marketplace App

This is a project initially conceived in August 2024, while I was working a landscaping job. I had the idea as I was looking for work, but was having a hard time finding it. I was inspired to change that. That's when I decided to create ForHire. I wanted to give people who have talents and skills the opportunity to find work using those skills. My dream is that my app can create a free trade market where anyone who is skilled and looking to work can help those around them.
